# Quantum Random Number Generator in Q#

This is a solution to the Quantum Random Number Generator problem in Q#. The problem is described in detail on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/3-random-bit-generator):

> Classical computers don't produce random numbers, but rather pseudorandom numbers. A pseudorandom number generator generates a deterministic sequence of numbers based on some initial value, called a seed. To better approximate random values, this seed is often the current time from the CPU's clock.
>
> Quantum computers, on the other hand, can generate truly random numbers. This is because the measurement of a qubit in superposition is a probabilistic process. The result of the measurement is random, and there's no way to predict the outcome. This is the basic principle of quantum random number generators.
