## Getting started

- Acquire basic knowledge of classical programming concepts
- Acquire a basic understanding of quantum computing
  - Start with the amazing videos from 3Blue1Brown:
    - [But what is quantum computing? (Grover's Algorithm)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWpF2Gb-gU)
    - [Where my explanation of Grover’s algorithm failed
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlsa9EBKDGI)
  - And proceed by watching a great [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists presentation from Microsoft Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM)
- Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install the latest version of the [Azure Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode) extension
